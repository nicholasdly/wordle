Wordle is a "guess the word" puzzle game that took the internet by storm.

- You get six tries.
- Each guess must be a five letter word.
- A letter is 'green' if it is in the correct spot.
- A letter is 'yellow' if it is in the word but not in the right spot.
- A letter is 'gray' if it is not in the word at all.

Some development notes:
- All guesses should be a valid English word; this can be done by having a file
of valid words where the "word to guess" is randomly chosen, and all guesses
must be within the list.
- Convert all words to lowercase, this should simplify the searching process.
